# libpolymc

libpolymc is a new proposed (and WIP) Minecraft launcher library for [PolyMC](https://github.com/PolyMC/PolyMC) that can be used to manage multiple Minecraft instances and create custom launchers.

The library is currently in a WIP state and is not yet ready for use.

NOTE: The `plmc` Example CLI launcher is now deprecated and will be fully refactored into the main crate.
